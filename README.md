# Happy Tab

![screenshot](./marketing/happy-tab-screenshot.png)

## Why
On Friday Oct 29th 2021 Google broke its brilliant design UX and started showing advertisements on the google landing page and the new Chrome tab window.

I'm an 'intellectual worker'. My 'mind space' needs to be as free and clear of distraction as possible.

## What

- Create a 'new tab' window that I can control and customize to my liking (blank page with a random quote for now, maybe more later)

## Alternatives
- Use Chromium
- Use Brave

## Build

```
$ npm run build
```

## Thanks
